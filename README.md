Phone Number Verification with Twilio and Java Spring Boot
Overview
This project implements phone number verification using Twilio's Programmable SMS API in a Java Spring Boot application. The goal is to provide a secure and seamless method of verifying user phone numbers through the use of one-time passwords (OTP).

Technologies Used
Java Spring Boot: The backend of the application is built using the Spring Boot framework, providing a robust and scalable server-side solution.

Twilio API: Twilio's Programmable SMS API is utilized for sending one-time passwords (OTP) to users' phone numbers, facilitating the phone number verification process.

Setup
Twilio Account:

Sign up for a Twilio account and obtain your Account SID, Auth Token, and a Twilio phone number.
Configuration:

Update the application.properties file with your Twilio credentials and phone number.
properties
Copy code
# Twilio Configuration
twilio.account.sid=YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
twilio.auth.token=YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
twilio.phone.number=YOUR_TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER
Build and Run:

Build and run the Spring Boot application using your preferred IDE or the command line.
bash
Copy code
./mvnw spring-boot:run
Usage
Phone Number Verification:

Users initiate phone number verification by providing their phone number.
The application generates and sends a one-time password (OTP) to the provided phone number using Twilio's SMS service.
OTP Verification:

Users receive the OTP on their phone and enter it in the application.
The application verifies the entered OTP against the generated one, confirming the authenticity of the provided phone number.
